            Currently a postdoctoral researcher in Okinawa, fascinated by the
            physics of <b>complex systems</b> such as animal groups and social
            networks. My research aims to understand the emergence of order from
            simple interactions using a data-driven approach combining{" "}
            <b>theoretical physics</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. I completed
            my PhD with{" "}
