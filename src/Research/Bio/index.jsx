                    Currently a postdoctoral researcher in Okinawa, fascinated by the physics of <b>complex systems</b> such as animal groups and social networks. My research aims
                    to understand the emergence of order from simple interactions using a data-driven approach combining <b>theoretical physics</b> and <b>machine learning</b>.
                    I completed my PhD with <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/lauga/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof Eric Lauga</a> at the DAMTP
                    (University of Cambridge). My doctoral research focused on understanding bacterial locomotion through <b>mathematical modelling</b> and <b>computer simulations</b>.
